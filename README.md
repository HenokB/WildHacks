# WildHacks
This is a project submiited for the wildhacks hackathon.

## Petrature 

### Inspiration
In the current times when covid has literally changed the way we exist as a species , apart from humans animals have also been equally affected. Limited interaction entails a lot of issues that we may have ignored in our efforts to combat the epidemic but that surely does not mean that those issues can be ignored. A lot of these issues have severely affected animals around us. Petrature aims to solve those issues by helping people realize how adopting and taking care an animal can change their life for good.

### Tech Stack 
The app itself is built using react , node js and mongoDB with a simple yet beautiful User Interface.

### What does it do? 
The app allows the users to share their stories and narrate their experiences with their animals not only that Petrature allows you to read stories from all across the globe so that other people who have one or are planning to adopt a new friend for their house, enjoy reading them and get some inspiration.

 
This app perfectly bridges the gap that covid had developed and now all the animal lovers out there can get together at a single platform and share joy and happiness.
